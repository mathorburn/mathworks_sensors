%% Description of files in Module 1

1. Signal_image_acquisition_IOS.mlx - This live script will show how to acquire real time signal or image from an IOS/Android device. It'll also show how to process the acquired signal/image in MATLAB/Simulink.

2. Rpi_image_acquisition.mlx - This live script will show the process of connecting a Raspberry pi and camera module with MATLAB/Simulink. It'll also show how to run a simulink model on acquiring image/video and detecting the edges.

4. image_acquisition.slx - Simulink model on acquiring image/video using a raspberry pi and camera module and detecting the edges.

5. Accel_acquisition.slx - Simulink model on acquiring acceleration signal from a raspberry pi and senseHAT.

6. Rpi_connection_doc.mlx - This live script will  discuss the procedure of connecting a Raspberry Pi with MATLAB/Simulink. It will also discuss some troubleshooting.
